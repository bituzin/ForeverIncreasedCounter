## 📖 Overview

ForeverCounter is an extremely simple yet powerful smart contract that implements a **permanently increasing counter**. Once deployed, the counter can only move forward - **it can never be decreased, reset, or modified** by anyone, including the contract owner.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **✅ Only Increases** - Single `increment()` function that adds +1
- **❌ No Decrease** - Absolutely no way to subtract from the counter
- **❌ No Reset** - Counter can never return to zero
- **❌ No Owner** - No administrative privileges or special access
- **❌ No Parameters** - Fixed +1 increment, no arbitrary values
- **🔒 Immutable** - Once deployed, behavior cannot be changed

✅ 20/10.2025 Update: Added Time Tracking Features (ForeverIncreasedCounter v0.2.sol)

lastIncrementTime (public variable) Purpose: Tracks the exact timestamp of the last counter increment Returns: Unix timestamp (uint256) of when the counter was last increased Usage: Directly accessible public variable showing when the last interaction occurred

getTimeSinceLastIncrement() (public view function) Purpose: Calculates real-time duration since the last increment Returns: Number of seconds (uint256) elapsed since last increase Usage: Provides live countdown showing how long the counter has been idle

Benefits: 📊 Real-time monitoring - See exactly when the counter was last used ⏰ Activity tracking - Monitor community engagement patterns 🔄 Live updates - Frontend can display "X seconds/minutes since last increase" 📈 Analytics ready - Enables time-based statistics and visualizations

## 📦 Contract Interface

```solidity
// ONLY function that modifies state
function increment() public

// ONLY function that reads state  
function getCount() public view returns (uint256)
