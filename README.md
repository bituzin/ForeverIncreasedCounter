## 📖 Overview

ForeverCounter is an extremely simple yet powerful smart contract that implements a **permanently increasing counter**. Once deployed, the counter can only move forward - **it can never be decreased, reset, or modified** by anyone, including the contract owner.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **✅ Only Increases** - Single `increment()` function that adds +1
- **❌ No Decrease** - Absolutely no way to subtract from the counter
- **❌ No Reset** - Counter can never return to zero
- **❌ No Owner** - No administrative privileges or special access
- **❌ No Parameters** - Fixed +1 increment, no arbitrary values
- **🔒 Immutable** - Once deployed, behavior cannot be changed

## 📦 Contract Interface

```solidity
// ONLY function that modifies state
function increment() public

// ONLY function that reads state  
function getCount() public view returns (uint256)
